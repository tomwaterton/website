                Some IBMers were struggling with the many internal IBM release

                While we have good content guidelines at IBM (see later section
                on this), it's easy for our designers to forget aspects,
                sometimes leading to poor UI content.

              <li>
                I came up with the idea of providing them with a way to check

                Some colleagues helped me get a prototype AI-powered Figma
                plugin running and I then worked on providing the content rules
                for the AI model to reference.
              </li>
              <li>
                I then iteratively tested the plugin on example Figma designs
                and refined the content guidelines and LLM settings until the

                Back in 2016, I was asked to produce IBM Design's first voice
                and tone guide. I started by conducting thorough research to
                understand what aspects of writing designers and engineers were
                struggling with.

                One IBM product team was showing some potential customers early
                product designs and noticed there was some confusion around some
                of the terms in the designs.
              </li>
              <li>
                The team were divided about which terms to use and unsure how to
                proceed so I was asked to work with them to help resolve these
                terminology issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                I designed and ran a 'cloze test' research study where recruited
                target users were given a series of sentences about the product
                and asked to supply missing words.
              </li>
              <li>
                This research activity provided the team with empirical data
                showing which terms resonated well with the target audience and
                which terms did not.

              <li>
                This taught the team more about their target users' mental

                which terms to use.

                IBM has a community of over 3,000 designers. And while we have
                some dedicated content designers (like me!), many design teams
                don't have access to a content specialist.
              </li>
              <li>
                So, in 2022, I was asked to create a self-service online
                education course to help our many talented UX designers, visual
                designers, design researchers, and other design colleauges
                further improve their own UX writing skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                After getting input from a variety of design colleagues, I came
                up with a course outline that mapped to both our Carbon content
                guidelines and to the content heuristics used in our internal
                product design reviews.
              </li>
              <li>
                As I researched and drafted each module I then sought feedback
                from some early adopters, which enabled me to further refine the

                Before being released, all products go through a formal 'Design

                I assess the written parts of the product UI against a set of
                content heuristics and provide detailed feedback to the product
                teams highlighting both the good content and the areas where
                content could be further improved, along with suggestions and
                supporting materials.

                For the last few years, IBM has run a fantastic (internal)
                annual design festival. This three-day event features
                presentations, lightning talks, panel discussions, and workshops
                on a wide variety of design-related topics.
              </li>
              <li>
                I joined the leadership committee for this in 2023, responsible
                for all festival content and communications.
              </li>
              <li>
                I worked closely with other committee members, speakers, and
                volunteers to ensure that all festival information was
                communicated clearly and on-brand.
              </li>
              <li>
                This involved writing website copy, event emails, and many Slack
                announcements before, during, and after the festival.
              </li>
              <li>
                A colleague and I also started a monthly Spark blog. Each
                edition explores one design topic and features talks and assets
                from the Spark archives related to that topic.
