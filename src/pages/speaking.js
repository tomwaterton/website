      <p className="">This session introduced the audience to some of the key concepts behind the Lean Startup and 
      design thinking approaches. I helped explain the value of treating decisions like hypotheses to be tested, 
      and how establishing feedback loops helps us to learn, refine or pivot, and ultimately increases our chances 
      of success.</p>
