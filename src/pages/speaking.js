      <p className="">I co-presented with my awesome colleague Maranda Bodas on the ongoing content

      <p className="">At this online event for product designers, strategists, owners, and managers I

      I also shared a fun exercise that I've used in the past to help product teams see for themselves

      of people, across hundreds of teams, based all over the world? In this talk I shared some useful tips and
