        <li>I work with lots of different IBM product teams. For example, in 2019, I joined 
           the <span className="strong">IBM Event Streams</span> team for 5 months.</li>
          <li>I worked with colleagues from marketing, engineering, product management, design, and sales to understand our 
            customers' end-to-end experience.</li>
        <li>I ran a content audit to help the team work out what content they already had published, what user needs it 
          addressed, and what needed removing, updating, or creating.</li>
        <li>As well as helping to improve the in-product content, I also helped the team design a new 
          set of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams">marketing pages</a>.</li>
        <li>The team won an <a href="https://uktcawards.com/winners-2019/">external award</a> for 
        the product <a href="https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/">docs site</a>.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Back in 2016, I was asked to produce IBM Design's first voice and tone guide. 
          I started by conducting thorough research to understand what aspects of writing designers and engineers were struggling with.</li>
        <li>I then focused on how we could best design and deliver the guidance so that it would be fun, useful, 
          and easy to use. (I've written a little about this process in <a href="https://medium.com/design-ibm/confessions-of-a-content-designer-9be86daca04">this article</a>.)</li>
        <li>Later, as IBM moved to using the awesome <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon Design System</a> for 
        all of its new product UIs, I began contributing significantly to the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general">content guidelines</a> within Carbon.</li>
        <li>This is something that I and others continue to evolve â€” inspired by the knowledge that Carbon is used 
          by hundreds of IBM product teams, as well as many outside of IBM.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>As recently as 2018, many people in IBM hadn't even heard of a content designer let alone worked with one.</li>
        <li>So I got together with the talented <a href="http://www.marandabodas.com/">Maranda Bodas</a> and 
        a handful of others, and we formed a small community of practice, which we called the <span className="strong">IBM Content Design Guild</span>.</li>
        <li>From an inital meeting with just 7 of us, our community has grown month by month, and we now have over 
          300 people engaged with us, including UX designers, marketers, and tech writers, as well as content designers.</li>
        <li>We hold lively meetings where we share best practices and resources and we've spun up various work groups, covering 
          different aspects of content design.</li>
        <li>It continues to be a real pleasure co-leading this wonderful and growing content community.</li>
